                            our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens
                            and storerooms, our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks,
                            our granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets,
                            meat markets, and other places too numerous to mention, how Useful
                            they are! In our ships, however, the rats oft set them at defiance;
                            still they are of great service.

                             or mice, awaiting their egress from their place of refuge
                             or that which is their home! How well Shakespeare in Pericles,
                             Act iii., describes this keen attention of the cat to its natural
                             pursuit!

                             by cats, as I was, and they will have a lasting and kind regard for them.
